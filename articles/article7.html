    <p>
      Long phone call marathons — we all know them: one call follows another, interruptions pile up,
      and the productive part of the day slowly slips away. But phone communication is sometimes unavoidable.
      Here are practical ways to survive (and tame) the endless calls — and even turn them into useful work.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Schedule blocks for calls — protect deep work</h2>
    <p>
      If possible, group calls into a couple of dedicated time slots each day. Blocking your calendar reduces context switching
      and lets you have predictable stretches of uninterrupted time for deep work.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Set a clear agenda before the call</h2>
    <p>
      Ask the caller (or send beforehand) a short agenda: 3–5 items and the desired outcome. Calls without a goal easily turn into rambling chats.
      An agenda keeps the conversation focused and makes it easier to end the call on time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use a “parking lot” for extra topics</h2>
    <p>
      During the call, note side topics in a “parking lot” list. If they’re not crucial to the current meeting, schedule them separately.
      This respects participants’ time and prevents the call from expanding indefinitely.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Timebox and give a visible countdown</h2>
    <p>
      Start the call by naming its length (e.g., “We have 25 minutes”). When everyone knows there’s a time limit, the group is more likely
      to stay concise. For long calls, use small checkpoints — “10 minutes left” — to wrap up decisions.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “A short, focused call wins over an hour of repeated context switching.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>5. Prefer async when possible</h2>
    <p>
      Not every question needs a call. Use short voice notes, messages, or shared docs for status updates and small decisions.
      Asynchronous communication gives people time to think and keeps everyone focused on work that needs concentration.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Assign roles and next steps</h2>
    <p>
      End each call by clarifying who will do what and by when. Summarize decisions in chat or in the meeting notes — this prevents
      repeated follow-up calls about the same topic.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Use tech to shorten calls</h2>
    <p>
      Screen-sharing, short recordings, or a quick shared document often replace long explanations. Use the simplest tool that solves the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Phone calls are not the enemy — bad structure is. With simple rules (agendas, timeboxes, async alternatives and clear follow-ups),
      you can turn meeting chaos into a predictable part of the day and reclaim your focus.
