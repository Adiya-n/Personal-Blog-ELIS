    <p>
      Freelancing looks so easy from the outside — work in pajamas, no boss, flexible hours.  
      But once you dive in, you realize it’s a full-blown business that requires discipline, strategy, and communication.  
      Every beginner makes mistakes — here are the five most common ones and how to avoid them.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Undervaluing Your Work</h2>
    <p>
      Many freelancers start by setting *too low prices* just to get clients.  
      The problem? Cheap clients often expect the impossible — and don’t appreciate your effort.  
      Set fair prices based on your skills, not your fears.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Not Using Contracts</h2>
    <p>
      “Let’s just trust each other” sounds nice — until someone disappears with your payment.  
      Always sign a simple contract or at least use written agreements in chat.  
      It protects both sides and builds professionalism.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Taking Every Project</h2>
    <p>
      At first, you’ll want to say “yes” to everything. But soon you’ll burn out and deliver lower-quality work.  
      Choose projects that match your skills and interests — quality clients will come when you focus.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ignoring Time Management</h2>
    <p>
      When you work from home, it’s easy to lose track of time.  
      Use tools like <strong>Notion</strong>, <strong>Trello</strong>, or a simple to-do list.  
      Treat your freelance work like a real job — with schedules and boundaries.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Forgetting About Self-Promotion</h2>
    <p>
      Even the best freelancer won’t get clients if no one knows about them.  
      Create a simple portfolio, stay active on LinkedIn or Behance, and ask happy clients for testimonials.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Freelancing isn’t about luck — it’s about consistency, communication, and confidence.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Learn from mistakes — yours or others’ — and freelancing will soon give you not only freedom, but stability.
