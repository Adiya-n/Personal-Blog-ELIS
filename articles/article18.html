    <p>
      Every developer eventually faces the same challenge: opening someone else’s code and feeling
      completely lost. Whether it’s a legacy project or a teammate’s commit, understanding unfamiliar code
      can feel like solving a mystery — but it doesn’t have to be painful.
    </p>

    <h2>Start With the Big Picture</h2>
    <p>
      Before diving into individual functions, take time to understand what the project does overall.  
      Read the <code>README</code>, check file names, and look at the folder structure.  
      Ask yourself: what is this code trying to accomplish? Having context helps your brain connect the dots.
    </p>

    <h2>Follow the Data Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Find out where data enters the system and where it ends up.  
      Tracing input and output through functions or API calls gives you a clear idea of how things are wired together.  
      Think of it as following a story from introduction to conclusion.
    </p>

    <h2>Don’t Be Afraid to Use Debuggers and Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Reading code doesn’t mean passively staring at it.  
      Use breakpoints, console logs, or a debugger to see how the program behaves at runtime.  
      Watching variables change in real time helps you understand logic much faster.
    </p>

    <h2>Refactor Mentally (or Literally)</h2>
    <p>
      If a function name doesn’t make sense, rename it in your notes.  
      Break long functions into smaller logical chunks to “map” them better.  
      This mental refactoring makes even the most confusing codebases feel organized and less intimidating.
    </p>

    <h2>Learn to Recognize Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Most developers reuse familiar structures — loops, data handling, and patterns like MVC or singleton.  
      Once you spot these patterns, new code starts feeling familiar, no matter who wrote it.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Good developers write code; great developers read and understand code — including the ugly parts.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Practice Makes Fluent</h2>
    <p>
      Like reading a foreign language, fluency comes from exposure.  
      The more you read other people’s code, the faster you’ll start recognizing intent, style, and structure.  
      Over time, you’ll spend less energy decoding and more time improving.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
    <p>
      Reading someone else’s code isn’t punishment — it’s a skill that strengthens your understanding of software design, problem solving, and communication.  
      The more you do it, the less painful — and more enlightening — it becomes.
