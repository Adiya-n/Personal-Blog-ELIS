    <p>
      Every developer, designer, or freelancer has faced this — the deadline is tomorrow, and there’s still a mountain of work to finish.
      The panic kicks in, your focus starts to slip, and time feels like it’s running faster. But don’t worry — you can still make it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Stop Panicking and Prioritize</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing you need to do is breathe.  
      Write down what’s *really* required for delivery and what can be postponed or simplified.
      Focus on the “must-haves” first — you can polish the rest later.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Break It Down Into Small Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      Big tasks feel impossible when the clock is ticking.  
      Split the project into smaller steps — each one should take no more than 30–60 minutes.  
      Finishing small tasks keeps you motivated and shows visible progress.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Turn Off Distractions</h2>
    <p>
      Disable notifications, put your phone away, and close extra browser tabs.  
      Use techniques like the <strong>Pomodoro method</strong> — 25 minutes of deep work, then a 5-minute break.
      You’ll be amazed at how much faster you move.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ask for Help (If Possible)</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes teamwork saves the project.  
      If you’re stuck or running out of time, reach out to a colleague — even quick advice can help you solve a blocker and move on.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Accept Imperfection</h2>
    <p>
      Your work doesn’t have to be flawless — it has to be done.  
      The goal is to deliver a *working result*, not an ideal one.  
      You can always refine it later once the pressure is off.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Perfect is the enemy of done. The best developers finish first — then improve.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In the end, deadlines are not your enemy — they’re your structure.  
      Learn to manage them, and you’ll discover how much more productive you can be under pressure.
