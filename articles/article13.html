    <p>
      Choosing between freelance and office work is a common dilemma for many IT professionals.
      Both formats have their advantages and drawbacks, and the right choice depends on your goals,
      lifestyle, and stage of career. Let’s take a look at both sides to help you make a balanced decision.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantages of Freelancing</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Flexibility.</strong> You control your schedule and can work when you’re most productive.  
      <strong>Variety.</strong> Freelancers often face different kinds of projects and tools — a great way to grow fast.  
      <strong>Income potential.</strong> With the right clients and workflow, freelancing can bring higher income than a fixed salary.
    </p>

    <h2>Disadvantages of Freelancing</h2>
    <p>
      The main downside is <strong>instability.</strong> Income can vary from month to month.
      You have to find clients, manage contracts, and handle your own taxes. There are also no paid vacations
      or benefits unless you create them yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantages of Office Work</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Stability.</strong> A steady paycheck, benefits, and predictable working hours.  
      <strong>Team support.</strong> You can learn from colleagues, receive mentorship, and collaborate easily.  
      <strong>Clear structure.</strong> Defined roles and responsibilities make it easier to focus on specific goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Disadvantages of Office Work</h2>
    <p>
      You might face routine tasks, less flexibility, and sometimes corporate bureaucracy.
      Also, commuting can take a lot of time and energy.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Decide — Questions to Ask Yourself</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you need stable income right now (bills, studies, family)? — Choose office work.</li>
      <li>Do you crave independence and variety? — Try freelancing.</li>
      <li>Do you want fast career growth with mentorship? — Office might be better.</li>
      <li>Do you value flexible hours and location freedom? — Freelancing wins here.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “There’s no universal answer — only what fits your current goals and lifestyle.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Practical Tip</h2>
    <p>
      You can try a hybrid model: work part-time in an office while taking freelance projects on the side.
      This gives you both stability and a taste of independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, what matters most isn’t the label “freelancer” or “office worker,” but how well you manage your time,
      energy, and personal growth. Choose what helps you stay inspired and productive.
