    <p>
      In the IT world, hustle culture often glorifies endless coding sessions, late nights,  
      and “sleep is for the weak” mentality. But let’s be honest — without rest,  
      even the best developers eventually hit a wall.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Rest Is Part of the Work</h2>
    <p>
      Rest is not the opposite of productivity — it’s a part of it.  
      The brain needs downtime to consolidate memory, integrate new knowledge,  
      and generate creative ideas. Many “aha!” moments happen not at the desk,  
      but while taking a shower or walking outside.
    </p>

    <h2>Signs You Need a Break</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your focus drops, and you reread the same line of code five times.</li>
      <li>You fix one bug but accidentally create three new ones.</li>
      <li>You feel constant fatigue, even after sleeping.</li>
      <li>Your motivation fades, and coding feels like a burden.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are not signs of laziness — they’re signals from your brain  
      that it needs recovery time.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Restore Balance</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Set clear boundaries.</strong> Define your work hours and stick to them.  
      <strong>2. Take short breaks.</strong> Use the Pomodoro technique or a simple timer.  
      <strong>3. Move.</strong> Stretch, walk, or do a quick workout — it helps blood flow and focus.  
      <strong>4. Sleep properly.</strong> Seven to eight hours is not optional — it’s essential.  
      <strong>5. Have a hobby outside tech.</strong> Painting, music, cooking — anything that’s not code.
    </p>

    <h2>The Myth of Constant Hustle</h2>
    <p>
      Working 14 hours a day might make you feel productive in the short term,  
      but it leads to burnout and loss of creativity.  
      Great developers don’t just work hard — they recover smart.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “You can’t pour from an empty cup. Recharge first — code better later.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Balance doesn’t mean doing less — it means doing better.  
      When you rest intentionally, your brain performs sharper,  
      your code becomes cleaner, and your creativity flourishes.  
      So close that laptop on time — the world can wait until tomorrow.
