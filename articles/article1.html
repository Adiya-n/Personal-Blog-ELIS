    <p>
      Mondays often get a bad reputation — the end of rest, the start of new tasks, and the reminder that deadlines are real.
      But with the right mindset, Monday can become your favorite day to reset, refocus, and recharge your motivation.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Reframe the way you see Mondays</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of thinking of Monday as the end of the weekend, think of it as the *beginning* of opportunities.
      It’s a blank page for new ideas, challenges, and productivity goals.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Set small, achievable goals</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t overwhelm yourself with a massive to-do list. Start small — complete one meaningful task early in the morning.
      That small win sets the tone for the rest of your day.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Keep your rituals</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it’s your favorite coffee, a short walk, or music in the background — little rituals make Monday more personal
      and less mechanical.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “You don’t need to hate Mondays. You just need to plan them the right way.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>4. Remember: every day is a chance to grow</h2>
    <p>
      Even the busiest days bring lessons — in patience, communication, or coding. Each project helps you get better at what
      you do, and that’s something to look forward to.
    </p>

    <p>So next Monday, take a breath, open your laptop, and start small. You’ve got this 💪</p>
