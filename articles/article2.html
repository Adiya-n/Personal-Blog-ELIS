    <p>
      Starting a new job is always exciting — new projects, new faces, new opportunities.
      But let’s be honest: the first day in a new team can also be pretty stressful.
      You want to make a good impression, understand the workflow, and not get lost in all the new names.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Learn before you speak</h2>
    <p>
      It’s tempting to jump in and show initiative right away — but on your first day, it’s more valuable to observe.
      Listen to how your team communicates, what tools they use, and how tasks are prioritized.
      The first impression you make as a *good listener* will stay longer than anything you say.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Don’t be afraid to ask questions</h2>
    <p>
      Nobody expects you to know everything from day one.
      Ask about things that confuse you, but keep your questions concise and thoughtful.
      It shows that you’re paying attention and eager to understand how things work.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Take notes — seriously</h2>
    <p>
      Even if it feels like you’ll remember everything, you won’t.
      Write down details about processes, tools, and even people’s roles.
      You’ll thank yourself later when you need to recall something small but important.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “The first day isn’t about proving your worth — it’s about connecting and adapting.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>4. Be yourself, but stay professional</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t have to act like someone else to fit in. Just be friendly, open, and reliable.
      Your work will speak for itself once you’ve settled in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every IT professional has been the “new person” at least once.
      The key is to take it one step at a time — observe, learn, and slowly become part of the flow.
      Before you know it, you’ll be helping the next newcomer feel welcome.
