    <p>
      Whether you’re coding, designing, or writing documentation, keyboard shortcuts can save you hours of repetitive clicks every week.
      They may seem small, but mastering them is a game-changer for productivity — especially in IT.
      Here are our top 10 shortcuts every professional should know.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V — Copy & Paste</h2>
    <p>
      The classics. Simple, universal, and essential. These two shortcuts probably save more time than any other combination in computing history.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Ctrl + Z / Ctrl + Y — Undo & Redo</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone makes mistakes — but these keys make them disappear. Undo (Ctrl + Z) and Redo (Ctrl + Y) are must-haves for developers and designers alike.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Ctrl + Shift + T — Reopen Closed Tab</h2>
    <p>
      Accidentally closed an important browser tab? One shortcut, and it’s back. Lifesaver.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Alt + Tab — Switch Between Windows</h2>
    <p>
      Perfect for multitasking. Jump between open windows without touching your mouse — it feels almost like teleporting.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Ctrl + Shift + N — Open New Incognito Window</h2>
    <p>
      Need to test something without saved cookies or extensions? This shortcut instantly launches an incognito window in most browsers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Win + D — Show Desktop</h2>
    <p>
      Quickly hide everything and view your desktop — perfect when your screen is full of overlapping windows.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Ctrl + F — Find</h2>
    <p>
      Searching through a long document or piece of code? This is your best friend.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Ctrl + Shift + Esc — Task Manager</h2>
    <p>
      Need to kill a frozen app fast? This shortcut takes you straight to the Task Manager — no mouse clicks required.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Ctrl + L — Highlight URL</h2>
    <p>
      Jump straight to your browser’s address bar to type a new URL or copy the current one. Simple but surprisingly powerful.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Win + V — Clipboard History (Windows 10+)</h2>
    <p>
      This one’s underrated — it lets you access your entire clipboard history instead of just the last copied item.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Knowing your shortcuts doesn’t just make you faster — it makes you feel in control of your workflow.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The more you use these, the more natural they become.  
      Soon you’ll notice your hands flying across the keyboard — and your mouse collecting dust. 🚀
